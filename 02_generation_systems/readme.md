## Configuration Parameters

### 1. Temperature
Controls how creative or predictable the model’s word choices are.

- **Low (e.g., 0.2)**: Produces more predictable, focused responses.  
  Example:  
  Prompt: “What is the capital of France?”  
  Response: “Paris” (direct, no variation).
- **High (e.g., 0.8 or 1.0)**: Generates more varied, creative responses, potentially including unexpected ideas.  
  Example:  
  Prompt: “Write a poem about Paris”  
  Response: “Lights dance along the Seine, casting dreams in golden hues…”

### 2. Top-K Sampling
Limits the model to choosing from the top `K` most likely words at each step.

- **How it works**: The model only considers the `K` most probable words (e.g., top_50) and ignores the rest.  
- **Benefit**: Ensures coherence by reducing unlikely or erratic word choices.  
- **Example**: With top_50, the model avoids rare words but still allows some diversity.

### 3. Top-P Sampling (Nucleus Sampling)
Selects words based on a cumulative probability threshold (`P`).

- **How it works**: The model chooses from words that together account for `P` probability (e.g., top_p = 0.9, or 90% cumulative probability).  
- **Benefit**: Balances diversity and coherence, offering more flexibility than Top-K in varied contexts.  
- **Example**: With top_p = 0.9, the model prioritizes likely words but may include less common ones if contextually relevant.

### 4. Repetition Penalty
Reduces the likelihood of repeating words or phrases already used, preventing redundancy.

- **Without penalty**: May produce repetitive text.  
  Example: “Paris is beautiful. Paris is lovely. Paris is wonderful…”  
- **With penalty**: Encourages variety.  
  Example: “Paris is beautiful. The city captivates with its charm and elegance…”

### 5. Sampling Mode
Controls the level of randomness in text generation.

- **Enabled**: Introduces randomness, leading to more varied outputs.  
  Example: Different responses for the same prompt each time.  
- **Disabled**: Produces deterministic responses, consistently giving the same output for the same prompt.
